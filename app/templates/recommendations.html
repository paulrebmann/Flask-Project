    <p>Rating scale from 0 to 10</p>
    <p>a rating of 0 indicates that the piece of furniture does not meet the customer's preferences or requirements at all, while a rating of 10 indicates that the piece of furniture perfectly matches the customer's preferences or requirements. Values in between would then represent gradually increasing matches, with higher scores indicating a better fit.</p>
